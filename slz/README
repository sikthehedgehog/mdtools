SLZ is a LZ77-based compression format for Mega Drive homebrew. It serves as
a good general purpose compression scheme, mainly useful for data that needs
to be used during loading times.

Provided in this package:

   * Compression tool source code
   * 68k asm decompression source code for Mega Drive
   * C decompression source code for Mega Drive

The source code for the tool is licensed under the zlib license. The source
code for use in Mega Drive is under an even more permissive license (do
whatever you want with it as long as you don't claim it as your own - no
explicit credit needed however).

SLZ stands for "sleazy" and the name was suggested by both TµEE and AamirM.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's a command line tool that can be used to compress or decompress data.
You can build this tool by using the makefile or just compiling together all
the C files. This tool is licensed under the zlib license.

To compress a file:

   slz -c «infile» «outfile»

To decompress a file:

   slz -d «infile» «outfile»

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

By default, the SLZ tool will generate SLZ16 files (the standard format),
which have a limit of 65,536 bytes (~64KB) for the uncompressed data. If you
need to compress more than that, you should use the SLZ24 format instead.
Beware that you'll need to use different functions in your Mega Drive code
for SLZ24!

To compress a file (SLZ24):

   slz -c -24 «infile» «outfile»

To decompress a file (SLZ24):

   slz -d -24 «infile» «outfile»

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

It's suggested to use the ".slz" extension to denote SLZ-compressed files
(e.g. "example.slz").

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 68000 assembly routine is provided (md/slz.68k) that can be used to
decompress SLZ data from assembly code. To do this, you should do the
following:

   lea (input), a6         ; Input address goes into a6
   lea (output), a5        ; Output address goes into a5
   bsr DecompressSlz       ; Call subroutine

Where «input» is the address of SLZ compressed data, and «output» is where
you want the decompressed data to be stored. It can output to either 68000
RAM or Z80 RAM.

The contents of registers d5 to d7 are clobbered after calling this
subroutine. The values of registers a5 and a6 will be right after the end of
their data, which may be used for optimization purposes.

If you need to decompress SLZ24 data, use DecompressSlz24 (md/slz24.68k)
instead.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also a C function is provided (md/slz.c and md/slz.h) that can be called from
C code in the Mega Drive to decompress SLZ data. The usage of this function
is as follows:

   decompress_slz(uint8_t *output, const uint8_t *input)

Parameters are the same as for its assembly counterpart (see above). Make
sure to include "slz.h" wherever you call this function.

You'll probably want to turn on full optimization (e.g. -O3 in GCC) when
compiling this function. Otherwise decompression is going to be very slow.

If you need to decompress SLZ24 data, use decompress_slz24 (md/slz24.c)
instead. The header file is still "slz.h", though.
